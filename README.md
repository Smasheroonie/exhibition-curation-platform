# Exhibitly

## Project Overview

This project connects the V&A Museum API and Harvard Art Museum API into one convenient platform! You can browse, search and sort artworks, then create your own profile in order to save them in your own collections.

## Tech Choices

- **Programming Languages**: **TypeScript**.
- **API Integration**: **V&A Museum** and **Harvard Art Museum**
- **Hosting**: **GitHub Pages**
- Implement **security best practices** (e.g. for handling of API keys).

The following technologies and tools are **suggestions**, not requirements:

- **React** for the frontend.
- **TanStack** for managing API calls from the frontend.
- **TypeScript** Express server.

## UI Requirements

- Design should be **responsive** and adapt well across various screen sizes.
- Ensure **accessibility** for users with disabilities (e.g., support screen readers, keyboard navigation).
- The UI should clearly provide feedback on interactions, display **errors** (e.g., failed requests or missing fields) and show loading states when content is being fetched.
- Design should intuitively guide users to search, view, and create curated exhibitions.

## Completion and Submission Requirements

The due date will be provided, but it will be no later than four weeks after starting the project.

Your project must fulfill the following criteria:

1. The project should be **hosted** and publicly accessible (from a web browser).
2. **README Documentation** should include:
   - A summary of the project
     - (you may consider recording a **video walkthrough** of your platform, highlighting key features. Host this video on a free platform (e.g., YouTube) and include a link in your README.)
   - Clear instructions on how to run the project locally, including setup steps (e.g., installing dependencies and configuring environment variables).
3. Meet the [MVP requirements](#minimum-viable-product-mvp) outlined above.

Failure to meet these requirements may result in project rejection.

## Optional Extensions

If you complete the MVP and have time for additional features, consider implementing the following:

1. **User Accounts**: Save curated exhibition collections within user profiles. Consider a back-end solution for securely storing data, and provide access to a whitelisted test account.
2. **Social Media Integration**: Allow users to share exhibitions or individual artworks.
3. **Cross-Platform Access**: Develop both a website and a mobile app.
4. **Advanced Search Options**: Enable multiple filters for more refined search criteria.
